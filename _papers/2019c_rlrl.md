abstract: "In sequential modelling, exponential smoothing is one of the most widely used techniques to maintain temporal consistency in estimates. In this work, we propose Recurrent Learning, a method that estimates the value function in reinforcement learning using exponential smoothing \emph{along the trajectory}. We establish its asymptotic convergence properties under some smoothness assumption on the reward. The proposed algorithm yields a natural way to learn a state dependent emphasis function that selectively learns to emphasize or ignore states based on trajectory information. We demonstrate the potential for this selective updating on a partially observable domain and several continuous control tasks."
